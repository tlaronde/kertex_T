# kerTeX distribution of D.E. Knuth's TeX typographic system.

![Quixante](http://kertex.kergis.com/img/quixante_half.png)

This is the main part of the kerTeX distribution, the bulk of what will
be installed on the Target (hence the 'T'). It uses **kertex_M** ('M'
for Matrix) in order to convert WEB to C for compilation. Both use
**risk_comp** as compilation and installation framework.

kerTeX is the **TeX kernel system**: the main part upon which
everything else relies.

**kerTeX relies only on a libc and, for
administration of extensions (packages), and slightly for MetaPost
utilities, on a reduced subset of POSIX.2 utilities that are indeed
available for any OS (MS Windows included via MSYS). And it will
stay this way.**

It includes all the D.E. Knuth's work and additions (John Hobby's
MetaPost, e-TeX, Oren Patashnik's BibTeX, D.E. Knuth and Sylvio Levi 
CWEB, Tomas Rokicki's dvips) as well a Prote, T. Laronde extension to
TeX and e-TeX that is the main engine, compatible with TeX, compatible
with e-TeX and providing the supplementary primitives needed by LaTeX
post 2e.

But see COPYRIGHTS for a description of who is the author of what and
what responsability an author has in the present work.
