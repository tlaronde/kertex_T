# kertex_T
kerTeX distribution of D.E. Knuth's TeX typographic system.

This is the main part of the distribution, the bulk of what will be
installed on the Target (hence the `T'). It uses kertex_M (`M' for
Matrix) in order to convert WEB to C for compilation.

kerTeX is the kernel system: the main part upon which everything else
relies.

It includes all the D.E. Knuth's work and additions (John Hobby's
MetaPost, e-TeX, Oren Patashnik's BibTeX, D.E. Knuth and Sylvio Levi 
CWEB, Tomas Rokicki's dvips) as well a Prote, T. Laronde extension to
TeX and e-TeX that is the main engine, compatible with TeX, compatible
with e-TeX and providing the supplementary primitives needed by LaTeX
post 2e.

But see COPYRIGHTS for a description of who is the author of what and
what responsability an author has in the present work.
