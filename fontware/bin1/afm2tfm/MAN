.SH DESCRIPTION
PostScript fonts are (or should be) accompanied by font metric files
such as
.B Times-Roman.afm,
which describes the characteristics of the font called Times-Roman.
To use such fonts with TeX, we need TFM files that contain similar
information. This program does that conversion.
.PP
The name of the 
.B afm
file must be specified. The name of the
.B tfm
file is deduced from the afm one unless specified.
.PP
Here is a list of the environment variables affect the behavior of
.IR afm2tfm :
.TP
.B KERTEXFONTS
Search path for
.I afm
and
.I encoding
files. (The read-only input files.)
It should be semicolon separated,
and start with dot. The default is set according to the kerTeX
installation.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -O
forces all character designations in the resultant
.I vpl
file be given as octal values; this is useful for symbol or other
special-purposes fonts where character names such as `A' have no
meaning.
.TP
.B -u
do not include characters present in the font but not specified in the
encoding. Normally,
.B afm2tfm
tries to include both characters that fit the output encoding and any
additional characters that might exist in the font.
.TP
.B -v vplfile[.vpl]
make a Virtual Property List file as well as the
.I tfm
.
.TP
.B -V vplfile[.vpl]
same as 
.B -v
but the virtual property list generated is a for a small caps font 
obtained by scaling uppercase letters by 0.8 to typeset lowercase.
This font handles accented letters and retains proper kerning.
.TP
.B -c scale
when creating a small caps font (see above), the scaling for the `lower'
case will be changed from the default 0.8 to the fraction specified
here.
.TP
.B -e ratio
All characters are streched horizontally by the stated ratio. If it is
less than 1.0, you get a condensed font.
.TP
.B -s slant
All characters are slanted to the right by the stated slant. If it is
negative, the letters slope to the left (or they might be upright if you
start with an italic font).
.TP
.B -p encodingfile
specifies a file to use for the PostScript encoding of the font. Note
that this file must also be mentioned as a header file for the font in
the map included in
.I dvips.cnf
, and that ligature and kern information in this file is ignored.
.TP
.B -t encoding
specify the encoding for the target TeX encoding of the font. Ligature
and kern information may also be specified in this file; the file is not
needed once the vf file has been created.
.TP
.B -T encoding
specify encoding for both PostScript and TeX encoding of the font.
.SH FILES
.I dvips.cnf
in the config directory used by dvips (update this).
.br
.I conf/KERTEX_T.post-install
in the kerTeX sources for examples of the use to generate the
distributed tfm and vf files built from Adobe Core PostScript afm.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
dvips(1), tex(1), vptovf(1) and the dvips manual.
.SH MODIFICATIONS FROM ORIGINAL
This version of the program for kerTeX has suppressed the hard coded
encoding used as a default for output if none was specified. It now
takes
.I default.enc
in the kerTeX hierarchy. Ligatures are taken exclusively from the
encoding used (whether the specified or the default if none), and no
ligature is added implicitely if none was specified in the encoding
given.
.SH OVERVIEW
A
.I .tfm
file is what is seen and used by TeX. A tfm file can be created
from a Virtual Property List
.I .vpl
along with a binary version of this property list: a virtual font
.I .vf
. The virtual font is not used by TeX, but by a dvi driver (for example
dvips(1)).
.SH BUGS
An option to add letterspacing to the virtual font (via the virtual
property list) was rejected by Donald E. Knuth because it would make 
the fi and fl ligatures break the normal rhythmic pattern.
