==================== 1) TRIP and ETRIP tests in three modes

The first pass is to qualify Prote as a TeX implementation and as an
e-TeX implementation, in the three modes: TeX compatibility; e-TeX
compatibility and Prote mode.

We simply call the routine for testing e-TeX since this one calls, first
the routine for testing TeX compatibility.

cat <<EOT
==================== 2) Prote tests

The second pass is not a torture test, since, at the moment, Prote
adds only features that have a function early, in the mouth.

So this tests all the primitives in turn, in order to verify the API
contract as specified in the Prote manual.

Note: discrepancy in time displayed by timer is normal since it depends
on the node the process is running on... It should work, but the values
(incrementing) may vary.
