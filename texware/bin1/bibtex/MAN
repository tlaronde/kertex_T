.SH NAME
bibtex \- producing a bibliographic reference list to be formatted by
TeX.
.SH DESCRIPTION
BibTeX is a bibliography program to be used with an incarnation of
TeX (it is no longer limited to LaTeX). BibTeX mastered a file
produced by a first pass of TeX to generate a TeX description to
be formatted by it afterwards.
.P

.SH FILES ON ENTRY
.I btxmac
the plain TeX BibTeX macro-definitions to be included if not using
LaTeX.
.br
.I somestyle.bst
a specially written style specification to be used for the produced
reference list.
.br
.I somebib.bib
a specially written bibliography database from which the entries will
be extracted.
.br
.I sometex.tex
the TeX to be formatted text, including the BibTeX macro-definitions,
the directives \\cite{key}, the definition of the bibliography
database to use (\\bibliography{somebib}), the style
(\\bibliographystyle{somestyle}).
.br

.SH Invocation
This is a two steps process. One first invokes the TeX incarnation (could
be latex or other):
.br
.B tex sometex
.br
that produces a
.I sometex.aux
that lists the citations.
.P
Then on this produced auxiliary file, the invocation :
.br
.B bibtex sometex
.br
produces
.I sometex.bbl
and
.I sometex.blg
.
.P
These files produced, two successive invocations of the TeX incarnation
(could be latex or other):
.br
.B tex sometex
.br
once more
.br
.B tex sometex
.br
produces the (hopefully) desired result with the embedded bibliography
and references.
