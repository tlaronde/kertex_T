========== DONE

The full document explaining the test and the results is in:

$KERTEX_LIBDIR/mf/trap/trapman.tex.

In brief, the only divergences acceptable are:
	1) The banner (kerTeX C version etc.), the name and the dates.
	2) The total number and length of strings at the end and/or
		"still untouched" may well be different.
	3) The memory usage statistics.
	4) The %CAPSULE# may be different, but there shall be a uniq mapping
	between the numbers, the corresponding %CAPSULE# appearing in the
	same places and exhibiting the same dependencies.

In other words: some "comments" or "CAPSULE names" may diverge; the 
processing and results shall not!
